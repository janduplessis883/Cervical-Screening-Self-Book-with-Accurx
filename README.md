# **Cervical Screening Self-Book with Accurx**
`Brompton Health PCN`

### The introduction of SMS interventions at participating practices appears to have correlated with an **immediate spike in cervical screenings**, suggesting an effective strategy for increasing health engagement, though further analysis is necessary to **confirm long-term efficacy and causation**.

Interpreting the plots, it appears to show two key data trends over time: the number of female registrations aged 24-64 years and the monthly cervical screening count at participating practices. The vertical dashed red line indicates the start of an intervention using SMS (text messaging), which began on October 12, 2023. for ECS and Nov,1 2023 for the TCP and SMW.

## Here's what we can discern from the charts:

**Before the Intervention:** Prior to the SMS intervention, there is a fluctuating but generally consistent gap between female registrations and the number of cervical screenings. This suggests a variance in the uptake of cervical smear tests among those registered.

**After the Intervention:** There is a significant spike in the number of cervical screenings in the month following the start of the SMS intervention, indicating a potential positive impact of the SMS reminders on the uptake of cervical smear tests. This peak is the highest point on the graph for the monthly cervical screening count, suggesting that the SMS intervention might have been effective in encouraging more women to undergo screening.

**Statistical Summary:** The mean monthly cervical screening rate before the intervention is noted as 29.58, and the mean monthly registrations for females in the cervical screening age group is 17.12. The mean difference of 12.46 could reflect the average gap between registrations and screenings conducted each month.

Itâ€™s important to note that while the **immediate increase in screenings after the start of the SMS intervention suggests a correlation, further analysis would be required to establish causation.** This would include looking at longer-term trends, ruling out other factors that might have influenced the spike, and potentially comparing with a control group.

Additionally, the sharp decline in screenings right after the peak might indicate that while the SMS intervention had an initial impact, its effect may not have been sustained over time, or it could be due to other factors not visible on this graph, such as seasonal variations or operational issues at the practice. A careful examination of the full context of the data and additional data points beyond the scope of this graph would be needed for a comprehensive understanding.
